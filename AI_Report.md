🧠 AI Usage Report — Streaming Dashboard Clone (Next.js + TMDB)

This document explains how AI tools (ChatGPT) assisted in various stages of building the Streaming Dashboard Clone project as part of the StoryBit Frontend Developer Assignment.

📌 1. Purpose of Using AI

AI was used as a development assistant to improve productivity, get clarity on errors, understand best practices, and generate small code snippets quickly.
All final decisions, implementations, connections, deployments, and debugging were done manually by me.

AI was not used to build the complete project.

📌 2. Areas Where AI Assisted
✔ 2.1. Project Setup Guidance

AI helped me with:

Initial guidance for initializing Next.js 14 (App Router)

Setting up Tailwind CSS

Understanding folder structure

Understanding how Next.js server/client components work

The setup itself — creating the project folder, opening VS Code, installing dependencies — was done manually by me.

✔ 2.2. API Integration (TMDB)

AI supported with:

Boilerplate examples for fetching data

Explaining how to use environment variables

Structuring lib/tmdb.ts

Handling optional movie fields

I manually wrote, modified, improved, and integrated the TMDB API calls.

✔ 2.3. UI Component Boilerplate

AI assisted with initial versions of:

HeroBanner.tsx (base template)

MovieRow.tsx 

MovieCard.tsx

Header.tsx

SearchBar.tsx

I manually:

Adjusted styles

Implemented responsiveness

Fixed UI layouts

Added transitions

Modified Tailwind classes

Connected all components to data

✔ 2.4. Debugging & Error Fixing

AI helped me:

Identify TypeScript type issues

Fix TMDB API errors

Fix image undefined issues

Correct SearchBar JSX error

Solve Vercel build errors

Understand CRLF/LF line-ending problems

But all debugging was manually verified, tested, and corrected by me inside my project.

✔ 2.5. UI/UX Suggestions

AI offered suggestions for:

Layout spacing

Hero banner improvements

Better text position

Animations and transitions

I manually applied the changes based on my preference.

✔ 2.6. Documentation

AI helped generate:

Initial README.md draft

This AI_Report.md

Explanations and summaries

All final wording was reviewed and approved by me.

📌 3. What Was Not Done by AI

To ensure academic integrity and transparency:

❌ AI did not:

Build the full project

Write the entire codebase

Design the UI

Deploy to Vercel

Create or configure .env.local

Create the GitHub repository

Connect GitHub to Vercel

Push commits or manage version control

Fix errors automatically without my testing

✔ What I did manually:

Created and organized the full project

Connected GitHub repo manually

Wrote major portions of the code myself

Performed all testing manually

Fixed build errors using trial and error

Added environment variables

Handled Vercel setup & deployment manually

Ensured the final UI meets assignment requirements

Everything was tested, modified, debugged, and finalized by me.

📌 4. Impact of AI on Productivity

Using AI increased productivity by 40–60%, mainly by helping with:

Boilerplate code

Clarifying mistakes

Suggesting structured solutions

Providing quick explanations

Speeding up debugging

This allowed me to focus more on UI, responsiveness, and feature logic.

📌 5. Conclusion

AI acted only as a coding assistant, not a project builder.
The final project is fully implemented, structured, debugged, deployed, and polished manually by me.

This document transparently explains how AI was used in a limited yet effective manner during development.
